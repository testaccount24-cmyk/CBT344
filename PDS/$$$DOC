 What's new?

 25.03.2002:
 3.4Command Tracks
   Works for: + volumes
              + DSLevel without volume

   Does not work for: - DSLevel with volume
   Because I'm unable to get the DSLevel and volume from 3.4(panel
   ISRUDLP)(I tried ZALVOL, ZDLDSNLV, ZDLPVL and some other 4282
   variables) I have to grab the DSLevel or volume from the screen.

 TSOCommand VGet
   Lists all variables from the member VGETTAB.

 EditMacro MacroRes
   Added isredit preserve on.



 The fun starts here:

 EditMacro Add (<FromCol ToCol>)
   Adds the numbers in the selected rows. Display at the bottom line.
   Easily saveable with the MD(MakeData)-LineCommand.

 TSO-BatchCommand AWSExtra
   Extracts all the files from a with AWSUtil-produced dataset.

 3.4Command DelNoEnq
   Frontend for the BYPASSNQ-Program(Gilbert Saint-flour).
   Scratches the dataset under 3.4 with IEHPROGM.

 TSO-BatchCommand HLQInfo
   Produces a listing containing all HLQs and some RACF-Information.

 TSOCommand LDDDef <dddef-entry>
   LIST ALLZONES DDDEF(...). Says it all.

 TSOCommand ListVTOC <volser>
   &
 EditMacro MacroRes
   ISREDIT RESET

   This REXX works to display the contents of a volume
   and EDIF the result.  The resulting dataset display
   is very handy.  Just load the 2 members into a
   SYSPROC or SYSEXEC library and enter LISTVTOC volser.

 3.4Command LZ
   Requires Target4-PKZIP-Utility.
   Displays the contents of a ZIP-Archive.

 3.4Command LZD
   Requires Target4-PKZIP-Utility.
   Displays the contents of a ZIP-Archive more detailed.

 Job MAN
   For those OMVS-Commands...

 TSOCommand OMVSSEG
   Output is a listing of all UserIDs & groups and their OMVS-Segment-
   information. Could take a while.

 TSOCommand ShowDP
   Produces a listing of all active address spaces sortet by
   dispatching priority. Helps if your system is in compatibility mode.

 TSOCommand SMPEWarn
   Produces a listing of the |cataloged| datasets with dataset-
   information(like how many free directory-blocks are available).

 TBDisp
   Produces a formatted listing of the table. Handy for ISMF-saved
   tables. May take some time.

 EditMacro Y99
   Sets the memberstatistics to a specific date. Handy for resetting
   Y2K-touched members.
